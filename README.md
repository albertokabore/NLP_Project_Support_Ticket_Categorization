# NLP_Project_Support_Ticket_Categorization
Problem Statement
Business Context
In today's dynamic business landscape, organizations are increasingly recognizing the pivotal role customer feedback plays in shaping the trajectory of their products and services. The ability to swiftly and effectively respond to customer input not only fosters enhanced customer experiences but also serves as a catalyst for growth, prolonged customer engagement, and the nurturing of lifetime value relationships. As a dedicated Product Manager or Product Analyst, staying attuned to the voice of your customers is not just a best practice; it's a strategic imperative.

While your organization may be inundated with a wealth of customer-generated feedback and support tickets, your role entails much more than just processing these inputs. To make your efforts in managing customer experience and expectations truly impactful, you need a structured approach â€“ a method that allows you to discern the most pressing issues, set priorities, and allocate resources judiciously. One of the most effective strategies at your disposal is to harness the power of Support Ticket Categorization.

Objective
Develop an advanced support ticket categorization system that accurately classifies incoming tickets, assigns relevant tags based on their content, implements mechanisms and generate the first response based on the sentiment for prioritizing tickets for prompt resolution.

Sample of Expected Output

Please read the instructions carefully before starting the project.
This is a commented Python Notebook file in which all the instructions and tasks to be performed are mentioned.

Blanks '_______' are provided in the notebook that needs to be filled with an appropriate code to get the correct result. With every '_______' blank, there is a comment that briefly describes what needs to be filled in the blank space.
Identify the task to be performed correctly, and only then proceed to write the required code.
Please run the codes in a sequential manner from the beginning to avoid any unnecessary errors.
Add the results/observations (wherever mentioned) derived from the analysis in the presentation and submit the same. Any mathematical or computational details which are a graded part of the project can be included in the Appendix section of the presentation.
Note: If the free-tier GPU of Google Colab is not accessible (due to unavailability or exhaustion of daily limit or other reasons), the following steps can be taken:

Wait for 12-24 hours until the GPU is accessible again or the daily usage limits are reset.

Switch to a different Google account and resume working on the project from there.

Try using the CPU runtime:

To use the CPU runtime, click on Runtime => Change runtime type => CPU => Save
One can also click on the Continue without GPU option to switch to a CPU runtime (kindly refer to the snapshot below)
The instructions for running the code on the CPU are provided in the respective sections of the notebook.
